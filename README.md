##NOTES:
- If you want to play through/see everything in the game faster, you can change your move/sprint speed in the pause menu. I would recommend not doing this, but it will get you from point A to point B much faster.
- The central mechanic of the game is found inside the cabin with the smoking chimney after talking to the person inside, so be sure to explore that area.
- All models made + used can be found under the "Maya" folder, which also contains .anim files for some animations.
- All programmatically controlled animations can be found under the "Scripts/Animation" folder.
- If you want, you can jump past the terrain walls and "explore" the outside of the map.
